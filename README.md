# OSB Practice Lab

This repository contains Oracle Service Bus (OSB) practice projects that I am working on to learn and experiment with OSB concepts for integration.

## How to Use / Import

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kravhuravhu/OSB-practice-lab.git

2. Open Oracle JDeveloper or your OSB environment.

3. Import the project:

   - In JDeveloper, go to **File > Open** and select the project folder.
   - Choose the project file (e.g., `.jpr` or `.jws`) to open it.
